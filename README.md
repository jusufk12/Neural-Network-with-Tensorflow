Task 1

Different implementation of Tensorflow tools with iris data set

Task 2

mnist dataset with Convolutiional Neural network trained just with 10000 images (test images divided into 80% for training and 20 % for testing)

Task 3

Time seres data of stages of River Bosna in gauging station in Maglaj, Poljice from 2001 to 2011 (4015 days).
Prediction for t+1 day with the best result for look_back=3 (days) using Recurrent Neural Network with Keras library for Tensorflow. Visualization also included for last 270 days in testing data.
